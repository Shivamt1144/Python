name="Shylock"

# print("My name is "+name+" My age is "+str(age)+" My height is "+ str(height)+"m")
# we can also print like 
# print("My name is ",name," My age is ",str(age)," My height is ", str(height),"m")

# one of the better approach is 
print(f"My name is{name}, I am {age} years old, and my height is {height}")
