a=5 #this is valid because a is a variable
# 5=a this is invalid
# Rule: on the Left hand side of the assignment operator there should be a variable

# shorthand operator
# a+=2 is same as a=a+2
# a-=2 is same as a=a-2
# a*=2 is same as a=a*2
# a/=2 is same as a=a/2

''' we can also assign like this
a,b,c=1,2,3
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

'''
comparison/relational operators
<,>,<=,>=,==,!=
'''
x=99
print(a<5)
# output will be false
print(x==99)
# output will be true
